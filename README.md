# Climate Change Sentiment Analysis and Impacts on Housing 
As part of Technica 2023, we performed a sentiment analysis on reddit comments and posts to find topics that are frequently in discussion using spaCy, n-grams frequency distribution, and graphed it using Plotly.


Climate change has a major impact on the housing market, such as increasing insurance rates, making some homes unsustainable due to natural disasters, and financial distress for borrowers.

Given a climate change dataset/reddit post and comment history over the past several years.

- Calculate monthly average sentiment and chart these values; 
- Generate topic clusters from the post and comment text data;
- Visualize the data through a comparison temporal chart or other means. Were the sentiment values more diverse or extreme in the subpopulation?
- And as a bonus challenge create your own homegrown sentiment analysis that would predict whether the post or comment data is positive or negative sentiment.
